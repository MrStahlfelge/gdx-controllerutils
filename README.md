# gdx-controllerutils

Utilitys for using controllers with libGDX

## Subprojects

All subprojects are technically independant, you can use only one of them in your project. They are bundled in a single Github project because all have something to do with Game Controller Input and libGDX.


### core-mapping
Support configurable mappings for game controllers in your projects.

[Documentation](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-controllerutils/wiki/Configurable-Game-Controller-Mappings)

### core-scene2d
Key and button supporting Stage with focusable Actors for Scene2d. This is also usable in games without Game Controller support.

[Documentation](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-controllerutils/wiki/Button-operable-Scene2d)

### desktop-jamepad
[Jamepad](https://github.com/williamahartman/Jamepad) implementation agains libGDX' controller interface. Brings hotplugging on Lwjgl2!

## Demo

See core-mapping and core-scene2d in action in my game Secret Chronicles: [Web](https://www.kongregate.com/games/MrStahlfelge/secret-chronicles-classic-platformer) [Android](https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/dl/android?p=de.golfgl.smc.android)

## Installation

This project is published to the Sonatype Maven repository. You can integrate the lib into your project by just adding the dependencies to your `build.gradle` file.

Define the version of this API right after the gdxVersion:

    gdxVersion = '1.9.6' //or another gdx version you use
    cuversion = '0.1.1'

Then add the needed dependencies to your project. You will find the artifact ids on the subproject's wiki sites.

### Building from source
To build from source, clone or download this repository, then open it in Android Studio. Perform the following command to compile and upload the library in your local repository:

    gradlew clean uploadArchives -PLOCAL=true
    
See `build.gradle` file for current version to use in your dependencies.
